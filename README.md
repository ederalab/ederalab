### üë©üèº‚Äçüíª About Me:
üëã I'm Valentina, born in Rome in 1986, currently living near Alba, Piedmont, surrounded by amazing vineyards!<br>

üìö I graduated in Graphic & Virtual Design, then I took a specialization course in web design and web development, in particular I was very passionate about PHP at the time.<br>

üç∑ After a very long period working as a graphic designer and social media marketing for a big wine company in Italy, I started again studying development with [TomorrowDevs](https://tomorrowdevs.com/) and I fell in love with Python.<br>I developed a full stack project, a quiz site, with Django and I'm also managing contents and SEO.<br>

üå± I'm currently developing an e-commerce website for a project called Barru, project that I created from scratch a couple of years ago, of which I created all contents and graphics.

ü§ì I just joined the mentor team at TomorrowDevs.
